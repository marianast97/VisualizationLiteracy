# Orienting Guidance Interface

This folder contains the implementation of the **Orienting Guidance** version of the Visualization Literacy learning tool.

### 📋 Description
- Users receive subtle visual cues (e.g., icons or highlights) suggesting relevant modules based on assessment results.
- No ranking or enforced order.

### 🧠 Context
Developed as part of the master's thesis *“Guide Me Through Visualizations”: Investigating the Effectiveness of User Guidance in Improving Visualization Literacy*. This interface aims to support learning by providing lightweight, non-intrusive guidance.

### 🗂️ Note
This folder replicates the structure of the other guidance versions (e.g., `LearningContent/`, `Modules/`, `.streamlit/`) to support independent deployment in Streamlit.  
The only file that differs across versions is `Home.py`.
