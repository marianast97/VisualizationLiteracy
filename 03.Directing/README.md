# Directing Guidance Interface

This folder contains the implementation of the **Directing Guidance** version of the Visualization Literacy learning tool.

### 📋 Description
- Users receive ranked recommendations for which modules to explore first, based on their assessment results.
- Guidance is more structured than Orienting, but users still have freedom to explore.

### 🧠 Context
Developed as part of the master's thesis *“Guide Me Through Visualizations”: Investigating the Effectiveness of User Guidance in Improving Visualization Literacy*. This version was designed to examine how mid-level guidance affects learning outcomes.

### 🗂️ Note
This folder replicates the structure of the other guidance versions (e.g., `LearningContent/`, `Modules/`, `.streamlit/`) to support independent deployment in Streamlit.  
The only file that differs across versions is `Home.py`.
