# No Guidance Interface

This folder contains the implementation of the **No Guidance** version of the Visualization Literacy learning tool.

### 📋 Description
- Users can freely explore all learning modules without any system recommendations or visual hints.
- This version serves as the control condition in the experimental study.

### 🧠 Context
Developed as part of the master's thesis *“Guide Me Through Visualizations”: Investigating the Effectiveness of User Guidance in Improving Visualization Literacy*, this version helps evaluate the baseline learning effect without any system-guided intervention.

### 🗂️ Note
This folder replicates the structure of the other guidance versions (e.g., `LearningContent/`, `Modules/`, `.streamlit/`) to support independent deployment in Streamlit.  
The only file that differs across versions is `Home.py`.
