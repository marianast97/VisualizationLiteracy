# Prescribing Guidance Interface

This folder contains the implementation of the **Prescribing Guidance** version of the Visualization Literacy learning tool.

### 📋 Description
- Users are presented only with recommended modules in a structured, step-by-step learning path.
- Full module access is still available through a “See all modules” option.

### 🧠 Context
Developed as part of the master's thesis *“Guide Me Through Visualizations”: Investigating the Effectiveness of User Guidance in Improving Visualization Literacy*. This version explores the effect of high-level, system-driven guidance on user learning and experience.

### 🗂️ Note
This folder replicates the structure of the other guidance versions (e.g., `LearningContent/`, `Modules/`, `.streamlit/`) to support independent deployment in Streamlit.  
The only file that differs across versions is `Home.py`.
